# Time-Series-Final-Project
This was my final project for my time series class with the necessary excel files. 


My goal was to determine if the International Fisher Effect could be examined through the use of time series modeling techniques. 
I did this through by examining the effect of interest rates, trade balance, and inflation rates of the UK and US.
